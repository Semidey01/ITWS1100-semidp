## Summary

1. I created the database (iit) in phpmyadmin.

2. I created the actors table using a sql file that used queries. 

3. I created the movies.php code to display the already created movies table, using index.php as reference.

4. For the relational database I used a dropdown menu using JQuery that displyed the last names from the actors table, and the movie titles from the movies table. Using these two, I created a new table called movie_actors where they were both associated. 

## Comments

This was a stressful, yet educating lab. SQL tables were fun to use but the syntac often proved tedious. I tried to incorporate the delete button from the actors and movies table but it wouldn't work.
