# Quiz 3

In this quiz we had to repurpose our labs to add php to index.html, labs.html, and projects.html. 

I was able to fully apply php and phpmyadmin to my index.php, labs.php and projects.php.

I have code written for the login functionality, but the site crashes whenever I try to log in, and I have no idea how to fix this.

As for the modification of labs.php, I currently have a code that adds and deletes labs, but you must be an admin user to be able to see it. 

Unfortunately, becuase my login is not working, this feature cannot be fully seen.

Overall, I wish I had more time to work on this lab. I had my presentation due the same day as this is due, so that took off a lot of time for me, as well as other final assignments from other classes. It was fun to see how we could still achieve the same using phpmyadmin.
