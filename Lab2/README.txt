Created a second branch in my repository called lab2.

Created my resume using HTML and CSS in the lab2 branch:
 - Committed changes to GitHub desktop.
 - Committed to origin so that it shows up in the  GitHub desktop.
 - Used git-pull in the command prompt to push changes to the Azure VM.

Reflection:

 - I had previous experience with HTML and CSS coding, so this project was fun.
 - Encountered problems where I had <h1> as an item of an unorganized list, which gave me an error on the website.
 - It wasn't a challenging assignment, but it was time-consuming as it ended up being over 200 lines long.
 - I learned how to use div efficiently because, at the start, I was using div too frequently, which made the code look unorganized.
