#Quiz02

In this quiz I had to create an XML that contained a books collection with 5 different books, including their author and their description.

I also had to create another file tht used this collection as JSON, and write a JS script that would add these books to a list and when you hover over an item in the list their author gets appended.

There's also the word document where the other questions of the quiz are answered.
