Created two feeds using XML for my labs in my personal website.

First feed used an RSS format for the items.

Second feed used an Atom format for the entries.

Linked both feeds to my website.

Reflection:

This was a more relaxing lab compared to the last one in terms of time consumption.

It was interesting learning about XML and the differences between it and HTML

Learned the following:
 - How to create XML files
 - How the RSS format works
 - How the Atom format works.
 - How to style xml files using css
