This lab was extremely straightforward, but due to how my website is built, implementing security on lab 1 and lab 9 seems impossible to me. 

The way my website is made, all the labs appear in a single page, meaning that you can acces lab 1 the same way you acces lab 5, for example.
I've implemente .htaccess to my lab 1 and lab 9 folders, but it does not appear to work, as the links in my page are to the exact items, not to a lab 1 page. 

Other than that, I was able to implement index.php, where if you only use the FQDN it will redirect you to the main page.
