This lab was extremely straightforward.

I had so much issues trying to make the security work as all my labs are in a single page. Fortunately, I think I was able to make it work, where when you click an item from those labs it asks for credentials.

Other than that, I was able to implement index.php, where if you only use the FQDN it will redirect you to the main page.

Sorry to turn this in so late, last week was insanely stressful for me as I had a lot of work for SHPE where I'm part of the executive board, and this week I've had various exams and assignments.
