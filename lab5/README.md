In this lab I learnt some of the basics in html like pulling information from the html file,
creating variables, using window events such as onload, and creating functions and implementing them in HTML.

I changed the style of the form to dark mode to fit with the theme of my website, and created a return button
to go back to the labs page.

I created an introduction button that takes the name, last name, and nickname that is present in the form and 
displays an alert that says (First name + last name + is + nickname), in my case it would be Pablo Semidey is Semi.

I validated the form so that when you try to save it, it checks for any missing inputs, and displays an alert if there is any errors,
as well as display an alert if the submission was succesfull. The comments section has a message that disapears if you focus on it, 
but appears back if you focus elsewhere and haven't typed anything. 

I was able to change the background of the inputs whenever you focus on them, and also focus the first element when the page loads
by using window.onload.

Lastly, I fixed crime 1 in HTML by introducing the for="" element inside the labels so that when you touch the label it focuses the 
input box.
