For this lab I created a website that uses index.html as the landing page, and contatins three other pages: About Me, Work, and Contact.

In the home page, i went with a star background, something that I like, and fun fact, I have a tattoo of a star, so it represents me. I wanted to add some animation to the page, so I used a hidden block that moves position when you hover over the respective button.

In the About Me, I wanted to keep the black and light purple theme, so I added purple to the lines.

In the work section, I will create a separation for each upcoming course. I added a resources with all css files and a projets button, where all components of the course can be showcased.

In the contact I added my personal information, and made the instagram and linkedIn components have a reference to their respective website. 

In the Labs page, I added a navigation bar to each lab, so that you can choose any component you want within the lab page. 

Overall, i learned an incredible amount of things making this lab.
  - I learnt how to create and design grids.
  - Learnt how to animate and hide blocks.
  - Learnt how to create a navigation bar.
  - Learnt how to make items neon.
  - Learnt how to implement icons next to information.
  - Learnt how to make dropdown menus.
  - Learnt to play with percentages in css.
  - Learnt the proper way to make references to other files in your computer, so that GitHub can run it.

Overall a really long but enjoyable lab to make!

P.S. 

I must add that my resources button does send you to the folder with all css files, but I have yet to figure out how to let the user download those files from the folder. So, I'm currently working on that.
